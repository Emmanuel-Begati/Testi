# Year-End Testimony Service - Rain Effect Demo

## What's New

I've completely transformed the testimony service with a beautiful "falling rain" effect and updated it to an end-of-year theme:

### 🌟 New Features

1. **Falling Rain Testimonies**: Testimonies now fall like rain from top to bottom continuously on the projection screen
2. **Smart Selection**: When media selects a testimony, it smoothly animates to the right side while others keep falling
3. **End-of-Year Theme**: Updated from Christmas to a beautiful purple/gold year-end reflection theme
4. **Continuous Loop**: Testimonies cycle through and repeat, creating a mesmerizing rain effect

### 🎨 Visual Updates

- **New Color Scheme**: Deep purples, indigos, and gold accents
- **Sparkle Particles**: Floating sparkles instead of snowflakes
- **Modern Gradients**: Beautiful animated background gradients
- **Glass Morphism**: Enhanced glass panel effects

### 🎯 How It Works

1. **Default View**: All testimonies fall continuously from top to bottom like rain
2. **Media Selection**: Click a testimony in the media dashboard to highlight it
3. **Right Side Display**: Selected testimony appears on the right side of the projection
4. **Clear Projection**: Returns to the default rain view
5. **Auto-Cycling**: Testimonies automatically cycle to ensure variety

### 🚀 Demo Instructions

1. **Start the server**: `node server.js`
2. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000
3. **Add testimonies**: Use the main page to submit testimonies
4. **Media Control**: Go to http://localhost:3000/media (password: Christmas2026)

### 🎪 Test the Rain Effect

I've added sample testimonies to demonstrate the effect. The projection page will show:

The rain effect creates an engaging, dynamic display perfect for year-end reflection services!
