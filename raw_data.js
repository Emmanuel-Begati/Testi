I want to thank the Lord Almighty for answering my prayers, especially through the Tuesday prayer sessions. God has done so much for me, but let me share just three of the great things He has done.
1. God gave me a church family.
When I first joined the Tuesday prayer session, my prayer was for God to give me a church where I could grow spiritually and be truly blessed. God answered that prayer. He led me to this church, and day by day I am being blessed, strengthened, and uplifted. I am grateful for this spiritual home.
2. God cleared my bank loan.
I had a remaining loan of 7,000,000 Rwf. When my job stopped abruptly, I did not know how I would ever pay it. I kept putting this request in the prayer basket during our Tuesday prayers, believing God for a miracle. Today I testify that the loan has been fully paid. Only God could do this!
3. God healed my child.
Just last week, my child was very sick and we were hospitalized at King Faisal Hospital for five days. Even from the hospital, I joined the Tuesday prayers and called upon the Lord. Today, my child is well and recovering completely. God heard my prayer and restored my child’s health.
I am truly grateful to the Lord Almighty. He has been faithful to me, and I give Him all the glory. May His name be praised forever! Amen and Amen

Am delighted to share my testimony with you.
I spent years frustrated with wearing glasses. I couldn’t even remember my real look without them, and constant questions like “Why aren’t you wearing your glasses today?” or “Are they real?” made me feel out of place. I had marks on my nose, pain behind my ears, and even though people said I looked beautiful without glasses, it hurt because I didn’t have a choice.

I prayed for healing throughout my university years but eventually gave up, thinking it was a family problem I would never escape. Still, during services, I quietly prayed for healing.

Then on June 6th, after a week of prayer and fasting in which I hadn’t even participated—only followed the devotions—I heard a voice say, “Today do not wear spectacles.” I ignored it at first, but it came again. I worried about working around bright lights and machines without glasses, but I decided to try it for one week.

That very day turned out to be my miracle. I worked perfectly without glasses. I knew it was God. I’m so grateful for this healing.

Blessed is he who trusts in the Lord."		12/9/2025, 5:07:45 PM	eec887495a412

I don't mind sharing my name!	Nicole	Agasaro	250	792453804	"Praise God, Church.

I stand here today with a heart full of gratitude because 2025 has been one of the most unforgettable years of my life — not because everything was perfect, but because God showed me His power in the middle of challenges I never expected to face.

This year started well, but along the way, the enemy tried so many things to steal my peace, my joy, and even my strength. I found myself getting sick in ways I had never experienced before. I went from one hospital to another — important hospitals, big hospitals in Kigali — trying to understand what was happening to my body. I kept feeling unwell, weak, warm, uncomfortable, and worried. But every time I got checked, the doctors would tell me that everything looked fine or that it was only small issues.

But inside, I knew I wasn’t okay.

My insurance even called to ask why I had visited so many hospitals. That is how many times I went. It was frustrating, confusing, and honestly frightening… because I didn’t know what was happening to me. I had never experienced sickness the way I did this year.

Even in my own family, someone I consider my little sister was also sick around the same time. It felt like sickness was following us everywhere we turned.

On top of that, someone who is very close to my heart also became seriously sick this year. Earlier in the year, he had a simple motorcycle accident — nothing dramatic, nothing that looked dangerous at the time. But later, he began collapsing, having strong headaches, and feeling unwell without knowing why.

We went to the hospital on the same day, but in different hospitals  both of us sick at the same time.

That day, he discovered that he had been bleeding inside his brain. He had lived with that for weeks and weeks, without knowing the seriousness of it. He survived that whole time without collapsing completely, without losing consciousness for good, and without any major sign  and that alone is God’s power.

He went through surgery. But God, in His mercy, restored him. He didn’t even spend long in the hospital. Today, he is healed, he is normal, he is strong. God protected his life in a way that doctors themselves could not explain. I thank God because many people don’t survive something like that… but he did. God truly showed His hand over him.

And for me, through all the times I felt unwell, confused, frustrated, and afraid, God kept strengthening me. I am grateful because I am not in hospitals anymore. I am recovering, healing, and getting better every day. I thank God because even though I still feel some discomfort sometimes, it is nothing compared to where I was. God pulled me out of a difficult season, and I do not take that for granted.

This year also came with emotional battles. I had moments of anxiety that were very intense. My mind was overwhelmed, and I would get scared easily whenever I felt something strange in my body. But in those moments, I held onto God. I prayed. I cried. I fought. And with time, God calmed my heart. Today, I am better. I am stronger. And I thank God for delivering me from those heavy fears.

But even through all of this, God didn’t stop blessing me.

This year, I grew spiritually more than ever. I felt God close to me, guiding me, comforting me, teaching me, and shaping me. I got new friendships that became a blessing. I found peace in places where I had once felt empty.

God protected my family. We are grateful for being intact till date2025 , healthy, safe, and standing. That is a blessing I never want to overlook.

God blessed me with ideas and the ability to start my business. He provided the finances, step by step. My job went well, and God even gave me moments of rest exactly when I needed them most. He cared for my mental well-being and gave me strength to keep going.

Today, I’m grateful for the life I have. I’m grateful to still be here. I’ve seen many young people my age passing away this year, and every time I heard such news, it reminded me that life is a gift. The fact that I am standing here today is grace.

I thank God for the woman He is making me become, for the woman I will be in 2026, and for the future He is preparing for me. I thank Him for His protection, His guidance, His healing, and His love.

God has been faithful. God has been merciful. And God has been near.

This is my testimony.
Glory be to God.

This was my prayer on this mentioned date below;
My prayer Today 30th July 2025 on

God I come to you and surrender all my struggles, challenges in my life, the pain of not being in position to pay even for small things like ;
- Water bills
- My car battery.
- When your children asks for a vacation/travel even to the nearest place and not able. 
- A moment where you’re thinking of where the school fees will come from as days of school are approaching.
- With all these , am having a first interview written exam in this organization, the first shortlisted interview in the past three years of unemployment yet keeps applying. 
- These are just few from along list; yet lord I have known you as my savior, walked and still walking a journey of faith with you, my provider……name it.
Your words tells us ;
- “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.” Proverbs‬ ‭3‬:‭5‬-‭6‬ ‭NIV
God, with all the above stated challenges, I chose to trust you even when I was told that the exam I will be doing already has someone to occupy the position.
I know you’re the God of impossibles….you appeared for Easter and you’re the same God. Therefore see and act accordingly to your grace and mercies.

Your word God in 
- Ephesians 3:20 says, “Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,” and
- The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.”Psalms‬ ‭23‬:‭1‬ ‭NIV‬‬
- Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”Matthew‬ ‭7‬:‭7‬ ‭NIV‬‬
- The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” John‬ ‭10‬:‭10‬ ‭NIV‬‬ , and here he’s coming to steal my faith yet I have you who came to give us life in full.
- All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace. Isaiah‬ ‭54‬:‭13‬ ‭NIV‬‬
- Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’”Jeremiah‬ ‭33‬:‭3‬ ‭NIV‬‬
‭‭Heavenly father, with the above scriptures,I trust and believe in your word. Am calling on the God of Abraham,Isaac,Jacob and Joseph and their offspring’s…..asking you for nothing but to manifest yourself to me and my family. Hear me good Lord and answer me quickly, turn your merciful face to your servant and be gracious for am not deserving in anyway but just because am your adopted child who’s redeemed and saved by your grace. 

Create me a testimony for only victory belongs to you . Hear the whipping of your servant dear Sovereign Lord, forgive my trespasses and inequities.

Touch and save my family, lead them in your way to pursue your purpose and as for me and my house, help us to abide in you and to dwell in your house forever. 
It’s in Jesus name that I write this message to you my father, you who never leave me nor forsake me, come through in every way and I will praise your name.
Thank you for am expectant and believe that you know already my situation like you knew about Joseph’s and that I will see your breakthrough soon.
Thank you, may the honor and glory be yours in Jesus name I pray, Ameeeeen

Today , I am testifying that the lord  I called on  the 30th July 2025 ; mercifully and gracefully answered my prayer . God gave me courage to do the interview and successfully granted me the job in September 2025. 

This is actually one of the many prayer points , I have seen a hand of God in many ways and encourage everyone who’s going through a difficult season to just lean on Him, His word in Romans 3:5 says “Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”
‭‭ I deeply thank God for all that He has been in my life, this is just one small part of my testimony. He has walked with me through all my trials,as his word says; 

Hebrews 13:5, ""He has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake you',"" and Deuteronomy 31:6, ""The LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you"" and Isaiah 43:2, promising presence in hardship, and Matthew 28:20, Jesus' promise, ""I am with you always, to the end of the age"". 

Receive my testimony lord and let it strengthen/ encourage someone this evening who is going through some life challenges.

It’s in Jesus name that I testify and humbled my His love and mercies. Back then , I asked God to create me a testimony. He faithfully listened and answered. May the glory be back to Him, He’s the Alpha and Omega. 

I have decided to follow him no matter the circumstances, because through all He’s always closer than you can never imagine.

Amen and Amen 🙏 "		12/11/2025, 4:32:07 AM	dbb3a687d4b10d

It started with university rejection, failure for driving license, losing my job, and sickness in my family. I am 21 years old, for the first time in my life I gave a reason for a person who commits suicide, I think that is  how it starts. Being jobless, seeing my mom undergo surgery of diabetic wounds and hospitalized, my 14 years old sibling also diagnosed for diabetes  made me crazy about God and what he allows to happen in our lives. As He said, their will always be trial and tribulation but He's always with us. I thank God for mental acceptance gave my brother about having diabetes, I thank God for my mom's healing and how he provided, I can't explain where we got the money for medical bills for both my brother and mom who were hospitalized consecutively. I thank God for holding me whole,  I felt the love of God through cell member's praying together, their concern about my family and care and follow up. Tuesday worship and prayers kept me move in those storms, I saw myself learning how to pray practically (I didn't know many scriptures to pray with, but I could just repeat after our prayer leaders, it really helped and worked. Our prayer leaders thank you !). Family breakthrough series is another story in my life, it was eye opening on both my personal life, family and battle field for my future. Though the year started with university rejection, I thank God that it ends with admission and scholarship, and I can say that I am healthy physical, mentally and spiritual. My advice to youth especially but also same applies to elders, don't work this journey of life alone, it starts with giving a reason for suicidal person soon you may start to try. I was able to stop there because I had a mentor to talk to and gave hope for life(without judging me).

I had like five months straight of I would say mental and emotional breakdown, it felt like unending cycle, everything felt too much to do; waking up itself felt like a chore, sometimes coming to Church was very hard, the Holy Spirit would tell me that it was the first step for the devil to isolate, first it's like it's not that deep, next you make excuses and the before you know it you no longer go to Church. It was hard but i had to  learn that it's not about how we feel but about Jesus. Now the spark is back all is good. But there's still more to come.... God restored my relationship with my father🥳🥳, He broke me and honestly i'm thankful, He revealed so many things i didn't even know I struggled with, He worked on everything to it's deepest not just to the surface level.

Testimony

I want to thank the Lord for His goodness in my life. First, He gave me victory—a victory I could not achieve by my own strength. I recently sat for my CPA exams, and by the grace of God, I passed.

The journey was not easy. There were moments of stress, doubt, and challenges, but God was with me at every step. He gave me wisdom, peace, and the strength to keep going.

And by the same faith, I believe that I will also pass the exams I did last month. The same God who has brought me this far will continue to guide me and give me success.

Today I stand here to say: God is faithful, and He answers prayers.
May His name be praised forever. Amen.

I'd like to remain anonymous!				783795027	Part of my new year resolutions for 2025 was getting driving license and my degree plus new job. January I started the journey of getting my driving license, I prayed for this as you know its a scary journey. Feb God gave me my license on first trial. I got my degree from a very nice university ( Europe) I really prayed for this. During October, I did 3 days fasting praying for new opportunities/ promotion and Financial breakthrough. I told God that I want December to be my notice period where I was currently working. I didn’t have any idea of where I will apply and get a Job in 2 months. In November I got a call from a company telling me they have this open position and If I am interested I can apply, I applied and got the offer in end Nov, guess what December turned to be my notice period. God really showed up for me this year I am so thankful. There are so many cards I placed in that basket praying that God heals my Mother and me as I used to get really sick from small things, and God healed me and my mother. Surely the mercy and goodness of the Lord followed me this year. 		12/15/2025, 10:10:32 PM	b41b6a4e34d9a7

Earlier this year, I came to Rwanda to begin a beautiful journey with my husband. One of my greatest desires was to get a job, but I was discouraged by the language barrier. 

Many people told me plainly that it might not be possible that opportunities would always go to those who spoke the language.

For five months, I waited. I prayed. I trusted God, even when it felt uncertain and discouraging.

But before coming to Rwanda, the Lord had instructed me to serve with the teenagers’ ministry called True North. To be honest, I had forgotten about it until one day I picked up my journal and saw it written there. 

Immediately, I was reminded that God had already spoken. So, in obedience, I plugged in and began serving wholeheartedly.

During the True North Camp, on one of the dinner evenings, I received a call from an organization where I had already gone through two stages of interviews. They asked me to come for another meeting on Friday, the very day we were departing from camp. I went for the meeting, and after the conversation, I was told, “You will be resuming work on Monday.”
In that moment, I knew it was the hand of God.

After five months of waiting and trusting Him, God did what only He could do. Just as the Bible says in Isaiah 60:22, “When the time is right, I, the Lord, will make it happen.”"		12/16/2025, 11:27:53 AM	4afcef6034d9a7

In May, someone hacked into my system and stole people's money and then they framed me. I spent days praying and praying and then it happened on Monday. Boss called me and asked me why I stole other people's money. I told him that I don't know what happened. I told him that it wasn't me. I was wondering how I was going to pay the money. I didn't go home and went to my room and prayed. Then on Wednesday, when I got to work at about 11am, they told me that they had arrested the person who did it. So I thank God that He never leaves His child in difficult times. Thank you		12/16/2025, 12:12:26 PM	e4094f5db0d2bf

I don't mind sharing my name!	Adrien			783822266	"In January 2025, I was involved in a serious accident and spent about 40 minutes in a coma, but by God’s grace, my life was preserved. While waiting for treatment at the hospital, I lost sight in my right eye and stayed in darkness for one month. I prayed quietly, sought medical help, and asked my cell members to pray with me. One day in prayer, God asked me, “Why do you want to see with both eyes?” I had no answer, but I chose faith. After medical checks showed no problem, God healed my eye, and my sight returned.
Later, God helped me understand that He had opened my spiritual eyes, too. I saw children in my community who loved traditional dance but were being misled. God turned my excuse into a calling. With Christian trainers, we began teaching 15 children to dance using Kinyarwanda hymns and gospel songs. As we shared the gospel, 11 children received Jesus Christ.
I praise God for turning pain into purpose and leading me even when I could not see the way because He is the Way."		12/16/2025, 1:10:04 PM	d0dcd8ce797234

Felix	IRADUKUNDA		789069137	"After the loss of my parent and my dearest  best friend last year, I sought comfort in prayer, asking the Lord to help me keep moving forward despite life’s circumstances. This year, my heart is full of gratitude for everything God has done. He has truly been by my side.

One of the greatest blessings I witnessed this year is the bond between me and my relatives. They are loving, caring, and encouraging. Even though we are not all in the same location, I strongly feel the presence of the Lord among us. I pray that God continues to work through us, that we may be fruitful, and that those who do not yet know Him may come to know Him through us— from generation to generation—just as our mother wished and taught us.

The second thing I am grateful for is my cell group. These people are wonderful intercessors; you can truly feel the presence of God when you are with them. They are very welcoming. May God bless each one of them individually, guide them, and be present in everything they do.

I call CLA home, and I am grateful for everyone and every ministry.

Happy holidays, my beloved church. 🤍"		12/16/2025, 4:17:40 PM	d44d9f752df787
